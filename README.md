# leaflet-challenge

## Summary

This purpose of this project was to visualise an earthquake dataset on a map using leaflet using a GeoJSON file sourced from the USGS website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). The data set selected was for all magnitude earthquakes for the last 7 days. The points on the map are colour coded and sized according to the earhquake magnitude and can be clicked on to display location, date/time and magnitude.

GeoJSON source: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

The JavaScript file (logic.js) is located in the 'static/js' directory with the accompanying CSS file (style.css) located in the 'static/css' directory.

The website can be launched from https://ivana-stopka.github.io/leaflet-challenge/ .
